      <div class="quote">
        <p>Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. This kind of attention nurtures greater awareness, clarity, and acceptance of the present-moment reality. It wakes us up to the fact that our lives unfold only in moments. If we are not fully present for many of those moments, we may not only miss what is most valuable in our lives but also fail to realize the richness and the depth of our possibilities for growth and transformation.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>Every day has its drama. If you are waiting for a day without drama, you are waiting for death. Mindfulness is what gives us the space to meet all drama without tension. While we can’t always be free of drama, we can be free from the effects of it. It’s called peace of mind.</p>

        <p>When I dance, I dance; when I sleep, I sleep; yes, and when I walk alone in a beautiful orchard, if my thoughts drift to far-off matters for some part of the time for some other part I lead them back again to the walk, the orchard, to the sweetness of this solitude, to myself.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>When you learn to just sit and become completely present, you naturally become completely quiet, with none of that jazz going on inside. A person who can’t really sit as if there were nothing else to do also won’t be able to act because he’ll never be completely all here.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>Mindfulness is a quality that’s always there. It’s an illusion that there’s a meditation and post-meditation period, which I always find amusing, because you’re either mindful or you’re not.</p>

        <p>There are many ways to come back to the here and the now, and to touch life deeply. But they all involve mindful breathing. If we are anchored in our mindful breathing, we can practice anytime. Otherwise, we risk missing our lives, our lives that are lived in the here and now.</p>
