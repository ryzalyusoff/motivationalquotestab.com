        <p>It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.</p>
        <span>- Marcus Aurelius</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>No great thing is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig, I answer that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>You live as if you were destined to live forever, no thought of your frailty ever enters your head, of how much time has already gone by you take no heed. You squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, though all the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your last.</p>
        <span>- Seneca</span>

        <p>If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs you, but your own judgment about it. And it is in your power to wipe out this judgment now.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>Books are the training weights of the mind. They are very helpful, but it would be a bad mistake to suppose that one has made progress simply by having internalized their contents.</p>
        <span>- Epictetus</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s books each day… The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.</p>

        <p>A Stoic is someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into transformation, mistakes into initiation, and desire into undertaking.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>Appearances to the mind are of four kinds. Things either are what they appear to be; or they neither are, nor appear to be; or they are, and do not appear to be; or they are not, and yet appear to be. Rightly to aim in all these cases is the wise man’s task.</p>
        <span>- Epictetus</span>

        <p>Be a master of the mind, not mastered by the mind.</p>
        <span>- Zen proverb</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Difficulty shows what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. Why? So that you may become an Olympic conqueror, but it is not accomplished without sweat.</p>
        <span>- Epictetus</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Don’t just say you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person.</p>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Show me someone for whom success is less important than the manner in which it is achieved. Of concern for the means, rather than the ends, of their actions…I want to see him. This is the person I have looked for a long time, the true genius.</p>
        <span>- Epictetus</span>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>If you hear that someone is speaking ill of you, instead of trying to defend yourself you should say: ‘He obviously does not know me very well, since there are so many other faults he could have mentioned’.</p>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you but answer, ‘He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone’.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>Think of the life you have lived until now as over and, as a dead man, see what’s left as a bonus and live it according to Nature. Love the hand that fate deals you and play it as your own, for what could be more fitting?</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own…</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>Take a lyre player: he’s relaxed when he performs alone, but put him in front of an audience, and it’s a different story, no matter how beautiful his voice or how well he plays the instrument. Why? Because he not only wants to perform well, he wants to be well received</p>
