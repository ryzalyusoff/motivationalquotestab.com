        <span>- John Maxwell</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

        <span>- Ben Roethlisberger</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or conclude you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.</p>
        <span>- Colin Powell</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

        <span>- Frederick W. Smith</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Leadership is possible in all different ways, and in all different areas of life. Whether it is with friends or family, I expect them to set a great example for me, and hopefully, I will do the same for them. And that is all part of being a leader.</p>
        <span>- Steve Nash</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Leadership is not magnetic personality, that can just as well be a glib tongue. It is not ‘making friends and influencing people,’ that is flattery.

        <span>- Peter F. Drucker</span>
      </div>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Leadership is not about a title or a designation. It’s about impact, influence and inspiration. Impact involves getting results, influence is about spreading the passion you have for your work, and you have to inspire team-mates and customers.</p>

        <span>- Indra Nooyi</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

        <span>- J. Donald Walters</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Leadership is an individual sport, one that has to be fine-tuned to each of the people that reports to you. Leaders also need to provide the direction, energy, encouragement and inspiration for each person who reports directly to the leader as well as for the overall organisation.</p>
        <span>- David Petraeus</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Leadership is an ever-evolving position.</p>
        <span>- Mike Krzyzewski</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Leadership is an active role; ‘lead’ is a verb. But the leader who tries to do it all is headed for burnout and in a powerful hurry.</p>
        <span>- Bill Owens</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

        <span>- Andy Stanley</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Leadership is about having the courage to go against the advice of the so-called experts and doing what your instinct tells you is right.</p>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Leadership is about doing the right thing, even if it going against a vast number of naysayers and mediocre people.</p>
        <span>- N. R. Narayana Murthy</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Leadership is about creating, day by day, a domain in which we and those around us continually deepen our understanding of reality and are able to participate in shaping the future. This, then, is the deeper territory of leadership – collectively ‘listening to what is wanting to emerge in the world, and then having the courage to do what is required.</p>
        <span>- Joseph Jaworski</span>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

        <span>- Travis Bradberry</span>
      </div>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

        <span>- Robert Kraft</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

        <span>- Lewis H. Lapham</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

      </div>
