        <p>While all the other kids were out playing in the summer evenings, I had to be in bed at six-thirty. They did that to discipline me, but for me it was the wrong way to bring up a child. It gave me a feeling of frustration and of reaching-out-and-trying-to-please. I found the quickest and easiest way to do that was to make people laugh. I suppose you could say it led to my wanting to be an actress.</p>

        <p>This endless search [for personal fulfillment] leads every ignorant human being to engage in various situations and entanglements, which in the beginning seem to hold the possibility of bringing about a happy circumstance, but which invariably leads to pain, suffering, and frustration.</p>

        <p>The more positive emotions you feel, the happier you are. On the other hand, the more you indulge in negative emotions like anger and frustration, the unhappier you are.</p>

        <p>So just what is so fascinating about blame avoidance? … One is that having become alerted to blame avoidance as a phenomenon, you start to see it everywhere… blame avoidance is capable of being discussed at all levels, from abstruse philosophical analysis of the nature of responsibility to everyday conversations on the bus or in the bar that swap battle stories about the frustrations of dealing with big organizations whose systems and structures seem to be carefully designed to make ordinary human communication with them as difficult as possible.</p>

        <p>Our frustration is greater when we have much and want more than when we have nothing and want some. We are less dissatisfied when we lack many things than when we seem to lack but one thing.</p>

        <p>Producing good stuff can be quite tough, and it involves a lot of frustration, but I always like things to be jolly and happy, and I forget that’s actually not the point at the end of the day.</p>

        <p>She turned back into the room and began to walk to and fro down its whole length, without stopping, without resting. She carried in her hands a thin handkerchief, which she tore into ribbons, rolled into a ball, and flung from her. Once she stopped, and taking off her wedding ring, flung it upon the carpet. When she saw it lying there, she stamped her heel upon it, striving to crush it. But her small boot heel did not make an indenture, not a mark upon the little glittering circlet. In a sweeping passion she seized a glass vase from the table and flung it upon the tiles of the hearth. She wanted to destroy something. The crash and clatter were what she wanted to hear.</p>

        <p>Frustration: In my life, everything is nice, but every now and then people need some spice!! When I get frustrated they are always interested. Just leave me alone for God’s sake. I don’t need any sympathy, which is really fake.</p>

        <p>One of my biggest frustrations was watching people not succeeding. As a leader, I had a passion to see people grow and develop. I constantly was looking for ways to help people.

        <p>She had become attached to you both. She worked very hard for you, Henry! I don’t think you quite realize what anything in the nature of brain work means to a girl like that. Well, it seems that when the great day of trial came, and she did this wonderful thing for you without making a single mistake, you two sat there and never said a word to her, but talked together of how glad you were that it was all over and how you had been bored with the whole thing. And then you were surprised because she threw your slippers at you!</p>

        <p>Love as education is one of the great powers of the world, but it hangs in a delicate suspension; it achieves its harmony as seldom as does love by the senses. Frustrated, it creates even greater havoc, for like all love it is a madness.</p>

        <p>If you’re frustrated because you’re not getting what you want, stop for a second: Have you actually flat-out asked for it? If you haven’t, stop complaining. You can’t expect the world to read your mind. You have to put it out there, and sometimes putting it out there is as simple as saying, ‘Hey, can I have that?‘</p>
