        <p>How can you forget the day your heart is broken? The funny thing about a broken heart is that it’s not fatal.

        <p>Yes, I understand why things had to happen this way. I understand his reason for causing me pain. But mere understanding does not chase away the hurt.

You’ll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn’t mean you’re gonna fail at everything.
