        <p>But that afternoon he asked himself, with his infinite capacity for illusion, if such pitiless indifference might not be a subterfuge for hiding the torments of love.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>Deep yearning isn’t deep love; it is all the unmet expectations rising to the surface of your soul.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>But, here was a curious thing. The more I tried to give up thinking of her, the more I said to myself, ‘She’s nothing to you’, the harder I tried to pluck the idea of her out of my heart, the more she stayed there.</p>
        <span>- Sarah Waters, Fingersmith</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>You can’t own a human being. You can’t lose what you don’t own. Suppose you did own him. Could you really love somebody who was absolutely nobody without you? You really want somebody like that? Somebody who falls apart when you walk out the door? You don’t, do you? And neither does he. You’re turning over your whole life to him. Your whole life, girl. And if it means so little to you that you can just give it away, hand it to him, then why should it mean any more to him? He can’t value you more than you value yourself.</p>
        <span>- Toni Morrison, Song of Solomon</span>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>I knew I was in love with you. Was I an idiot for thinking you were in love with me too?</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>Because, if you could love someone, and keep loving them, without being loved back . . . then that love had to be real. It hurt too much to be anything else.</p>
        <span>- Sarah Cross, Kill Me Softly</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>...unrequited love does not die; it’s only beaten down to a secret place where it hides, curled and wounded. For some unfortunates, it turns bitter and mean, and those who come after pay the price for the hurt done by the one who came before.</p>
        <span>- Elle Newmark, The Book of Unholy Mischief</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>The hardest thing about being broken, isn’t the love you don’t receive, it’s the love you long to give that nobody wants.</p>
        <span>- Dinesh Kumar Biran</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Being in love with someone who doesn’t even know you exist isn’t the worst thing in the world. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Almost like passing in a term paper that you know sucked, but having that period of time where you haven’t gotten your grade back yet — that kind of exhale where you haven’t been rejected, although you pretty much know how it’s going to turn out.</p>
        <span>- Tonya Hurley, Ghostgirl</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>The thought of her gave me such a continual anguish that I could no more forget her than an aching tooth. It was involuntary, hopeless, compulsive. For years she had been the first thing I remembered when I woke up, the last thing that drifted through my mind as I went to sleep, and during the day she came to me obtrusively, obsessively, always with a painful shock.</p>

      <div class="quote">

      <div class="quote">
        <p>You have never loved me as I love you — never — never! Yours is not a passionate heart — your heart does not burn in a flame! You are, upon the whole, a sort of fay, or sprite — not a woman!</p>
        <span>- Thomas Hardy, Jude the Obscure</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>To want and not to have, sent all up her body a hardness, a hollowness, a strain. And then to want and not to have — to want and want — how that wrung the heart, and wrung it again and again!</p>
        <span>- Virginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse</span>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>I brought you here to tell you this: sometimes what we are searching for does not exist. We may sacrifice for it, even bleed for it, but it was never meant to be ours.</p>
        <span>- Esther Dalseno, Drown</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>She still loves him. This is the fact she wakes up to each morning. She checks it, sometimes, a tongue probing an aching tooth, making sure it still hurts.</p>
        <span>- Hala Alyan, Salt Houses</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

        <span>- J. Matthew Nespoli</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>It is that we are never so defenseless against suffering as when we love, never so helplessly unhappy as when we have lost our loved object or its love.</p>
        <span>- Sigmund Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>But why, she thought wryly, did a man seem more attractive as he became less available? How humbling to think one had so much in common with a cow stretching its neck through a gate for better grass.</p>
        <span>- Mary Jo Putney, The Bargain</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

      <div class="quote">
        <p>It is a terrible, wretched thing to love someone whom you know cannot love you. There are things that are more dreadful. There are many human pains more grievous. And yet it remains both terrible and wretched. Like so many things, it is insoluble.</p>
        <span>- Naomi Alderman, Disobedience</span>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>A big issue that some empaths face is unrequited love and all the grief that accompanies this experience. If someone truly is your soulmate or twin flame, the relationship will happen sooner or later. … Don’t put your life on hold for another person, no matter how badly you want to be with them. If it’s meant to be, it will be.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>I didn’t want to fall in love with you. I knew the risk and understood the consequences. All the warning signs had been in bright blinking neon lights. Telling me to run before I even got near. But our hearts are animals driven by instinct: it only wants and wants and wants. Mine simply wanted you.</p>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>You know, unrequited love is very difficult? It’s not just having this one-sided love of someone who’s far away. Being close, talking daily, liking a guy who’s constantly near me is harder than it would be under different circumstances.</p>

        <p>And my desire,’ he said, ‘is a desire that is as long as a year; but it is love given to an echo, the spending of grief on a wave, a lonely fight with a shadow, that is what my love and my desire have been to me.</p>

        <p>I have to admit, an unrequited love is so much better than a real one. I mean, it’s perfect… As long as something is never even started, you never have to worry about it ending. It has endless potential.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>I know that’s what people say– you’ll get over it. I’d say it, too. But I know it’s not true. Oh, you’ll be happy again, never fear. But you won’t forget. Every time you fall in love it will be because something in the man reminds you of him.</p>

        <p>I sometimes think there is nothing more painful than love denied. To love someone you cannot have, to stand beside your heart’s desire and be unable to take them in your arms. A love that cannot be requited. I can think of nothing more painful than that.</p>

        <p>I had never wanted to be one of those girls in love with boys who would not have me. Unrequited love plain desperate aboveboard boy-chasing turned you into a salesperson, and what you were selling was something he didn’t want, couldn’t use, would never miss. Unrequited love was deciding to be useless, and I could never abide uselessness. Neither could James. He understood. In such situations, you do one of two things – you either walk away and deny yourself, or you do sneaky things to get what you need. You attend weddings, you go for walks. You say, yes. Yes, you’re my best friend, too.</p>

        <p>First of all, love is a joint experience between two persons — but the fact that it is a joint experience does not mean that it is a similar experience to the two people involved. There are the lover and the beloved, but these two come from different countries. Often the beloved is only a stimulus for all the stored-up love which had lain quiet within the lover for a long time hitherto. And somehow, every lover knows this. He feels in his soul that his love is a solitary thing. He comes to know a new, strange loneliness, and it is this knowledge which makes him suffer. So there is only one thing for the lover to do. He must house his love within himself as best he can; he must create for himself a whole new inward world — a world intense and strange, complete in himself.</p>

Almost like passing in a term paper that you know sucked, but having that period of time where you haven’t gotten your grade back yet — that kind of exhale where you haven’t been rejected, although you pretty much know how it’s going to turn out.</p>

Why would you try to do that?” She saw immediately that this was the worst thing she could have asked him. “Because,” he said, so bitterly that it shocked her, “I’ve been in love with you for ten years, so I thought it seemed like the time to find out whether you felt the same about me.

        <p>When I talk about unrequited love, most of you probably think about romantic love, but there are many other kinds of love that are not adequately returned, if they are returned at all. An angry adolescent may not love her mother back as her mother loves her; an abusive father doesn’t return the innocent, open love of his young child. But grief is the ultimate unrequited love. However hard and however long we love someone who has died, they can never love us back. At least that is how it feels…</p>

        <p>There is no hard and fast line that can be drawn that says: Up to here, there was no love; from here on, there is now love. Love is a gradual thing, it may take a moment, a month, or a year to come on, and in each two, its gradations are different. With some, it comes fast, with some, it comes slowly. Sometimes one kindles from the other, sometimes, both kindle spontaneously. And once in a tragic while one kindles only after the other has already dimmed and gone out, and has to burn forlornly alone.</p>

        <p>And on that evening when we grow older still we’ll speak about these two young men as though they were two strangers we met on the train and whom we admire and want to help along. And we’ll want to call it envy, because to call it regret would break our hearts.</p>

        <p>Most of us can’t help but live as though we’ve got two lives to live, one is the mockup, the other the finished version, and then there are all those versions in between. But there’s only one, and before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now there’s sorrow. I don’t envy the pain. But I envy you the pain.</p>

        <p>Everyone goes through a period of Traviamento – when we take, say, a different turn in life, the other via. Dante himself did. Some recover, some pretend to recover, some never come back, some chicken out before even starting, and some, for fear of taking any turns, find themselves leading the wrong life all life long.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>If there is pain, nurse it, and if there is a flame, don’t snuff it out, don’t be brutal with it. Withdrawal can be a terrible thing when it keeps us awake at night, and watching others forget us sooner than we’d want to be forgotten is no better. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything – what a waste!</p>

        <p>You made me who I am today, Nanni. Wherever I go, everyone I see and crave is ultimately measured by the glow of your light. If my life were a boat, you were the one who stepped on board, turned on its running lights, and was never heard from again. All this might as well be in my head, and in my head it stays. But I’ve lived and loved by your light alone. In a bus, on a busy street, in class, in a crowded concert hall, once or twice a year, whether for a man or a woman, my heart still jolts when I spot your look-alike. We love only once in our lives, my father had said, sometimes too early, sometimes too late; the other times are always a touch deliberate.</p>

        <p>…the sad part is, that I will probably end up loving you without you for much longer than I loved you when I knew you. Some people might find that strange.
