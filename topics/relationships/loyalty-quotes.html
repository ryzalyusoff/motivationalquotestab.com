        <p>I have a loyalty that runs in my bloodstream, when I lock into someone or something, you can’t get me away from it because I commit that thoroughly. That’s in friendship, that’s a deal, that’s a commitment. Don’t give me paper _ I can get the same lawyer who drew it up to break it. But if you shake my hand, that’s for life..</p>

        <p>When people show loyalty to you, you take care of those who are with you. It’s how it goes with everything. If you have a small circle of friends, and one of those friends doesn’t stay loyal to you, they don’t stay your friend for very long.</p>

        <p>What is a disloyal act? A person is disloyal if he treats you as a stranger when, in fact, he belongs to you as a friend or partner. Each of us is bound to some special others by the invisible fibers of loyalty.</p>

        <p>I don’t have an issue with marrying an actor, though it’s definitely tough. I work with actors and interact with star wives, and I don’t know how they do it. Loyalty is a very important factor for me, and I need to be in a relationship where the person will complete me and fill me up.</p>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Loyalty is dead, the experts proclaim, and the statistics seem to bear them out. On average, U.S. corporations now lose half their customers in five years, half their employees in four, and half their investors in less than one. We seem to face a future in which the only business relationships will be opportunistic transactions between virtual strangers.</p>

        <p>I have my own high standards for what I want in a partner and how I want to be treated. I bring a lot to the table. I’m not talking about material things but what I have to offer as a person – love and loyalty and all the things that make a good relationship.</p>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>A woman’s loyalty is tested when her man has nothing. A man’s loyalty is tested when he has everything.</p>
        <span>- </span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>My dear boy, the people who only love once in their lives are really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect</p>

        <span>- Clarence Francis</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>You have to move in life, but the loyalty you develop in a community is always remembered. But if you leave, you don’t pick it up in the next town. It’s not an add-on, you know, because you lose what you had.</p>
        <span>- Richard DeVos</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Our modern, rootless times do seem to be a particularly inhospitable environment for loyalty. We come and go so relentlessly that our friendships can’t but come and go too. What sort of loyalty is there in the age of Facebook, when friendship is a costless transaction, a business of flip reciprocity… Friendship held together by nothing more permanent than hyperlinks is hardly the stuff of selfless fidelity.</p>
        <span>- Eric Felten</span>
