        <p>I always try to be myself. Ever since I was an introverted kid, I’d get on stage and be able to break out of my shell.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>Our culture is biased against quiet and reserved people, but introverts are responsible for some of humanity’s greatest achievements.</p>
        <span>- Susan Cain</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Shyness is about the fear of social judgments – at a job interview or a party you might be excessively worried about what people think of you. Whereas an introvert might not feel any of those things at all, they simply have the preference to be in a quieter setting.</p>
        <span>- Susan Cain</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>I am a mild introvert. But I have learned to be a very successful extrovert because if you want impact, you have to work with people.</p>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>I’m really an inner spirit that only makes itself known through the music. A lot of people think I’m an introvert, or quiet and moody. I’ve even heard some people say that there’s a certain mystery or darkness about me. I’m not that way. I’m just really into what I do.</p>
        <span>- Faith Evans</span>

        <p>When an introvert is quiet, don’t assume he is depressed, snobbish or socially deficient.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>Introverts are more effective leaders of proactive employees. When you have a creative, energetic work force, an introvert is going to draw out that energy better.</p>
        <span>- Laurie Helgoe</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>I am more of an introvert person who is a little shy to get into random chat. I would rather observe people silently.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>I’m an introvert… I love being by myself, love being outdoors, love taking a long walk with my dogs and looking at the trees, flowers, and the sky.</p>
        <span>- Audrey Hepburn</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Don’t think of introversion as something that needs to be cured… Spend your free time the way you like, not the way you think you’re supposed to.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>Introverts, in contrast, may have strong social skills and enjoy parties and business meetings, but after a while wish they were home in their pajamas. They prefer to devote their social energies to close friends, colleagues, and family.</p>
        <span>- Susan Cain</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Introverts think carefully before they speak. We can be excellent public speakers because we prepare carefully.</p>
        <span>- Sophia Dembling</span>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Introverts live in two worlds: We visit the world of people, but solitude and the inner world will always be our home.</p>
        <span>- Jenn Granneman</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Introverts listen more than they talk, think before they speak, and often feel as if they express themselves better in writing than in conversation. They tend to dislike conflict. Many have a horror for small talk, but enjoy deep discussions.</p>
        <span>- Susan Cain</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Introverts don’t get lonely if they don’t socialize with a lot of people, but we do get lonely if we don’t have intimate interactions on a regular basis.</p>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Introverts are offered keys to private gardens full of riches. To possess such a key is to tumble like Alice down her rabbit hole. She didn’t choose to go to Wonderland – but she made of it an adventure that was fresh and fantastic and very much her own.</p>
        <span>- Susan Cain</span>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>An introvert may feel asocial when pressured to go to a party that doesn’t interest her. But for her, the event does not promise meaningful interaction. In fact, she knows that the party will leave her feeling more alone and alienated.</p>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Being introverted, it doesn’t mean necessarily being shy or being afraid of public speaking; it just means that it’s hard for me to interact with people for too long.</p>

        <p>How much better is silence; the coffee cup, the table. How much better to sit by myself like the solitary sea-bird that opens its wings on the stake. Let me sit here forever with bare things, this coffee cup, this knife, this fork, things in themselves, myself being myself.</p>
        <span>- Virginia Wolf</span>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>If you’re an introvert, you also know that the bias against quiet can cause deep psychic pain. As a child you might have overheard your parents apologize for your shyness. Or at school you might have been prodded to come ‘out of your shell’</p>

      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">

        <span>- Laurie Helgoe</span>
      </div>
    
      <div class="quote">
        <p>Many people believe that introversion is about being antisocial, and that’s really a misperception. Because actually it’s just that introverts are differently social. So they would prefer to have a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed to going to a loud party full of strangers.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>I like cancelled plans. And empty bookstores. I like rainy days and thunderstorms. And quiet coffee shops. I like messy beds and over-worn pajamas. Most of all, I like the small joys that a simple life brings.</p>

        <p>When I am alone I can become invisible. I can sit on the top of a dune as motionless as an uprise of weeds, until the foxes run by unconcerned. I can hear the almost unhearable sound of the roses singing.</p>

        <p>After an hour or two of being socially on, we introverts need to turn off and recharge. This isn’t antisocial. It isn’t a sign of depression.</p>
