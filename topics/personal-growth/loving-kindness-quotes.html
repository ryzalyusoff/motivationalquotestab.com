        <p>Some people know how to remain kind and thoughtful, despite the responsibilities and annoyances of a full life; others are so overwhelmed by nothing that they are longfaced and silent, much to the hurt of those with whom they must deal. I like men who are sleek and well fed, men who are happy. The people who are happy are those who know the value of white hyacinths as food for the soul. They are satisfied with one loaf and know that souls also must be fed. Kindness to others, appreciation of the good points of one’s companions, understanding of the mental vagaries and illness that cause discontent and misunderstanding are white hyacinths with even more charm than Tennyson’s poetry or Emerson’s essays. This morning an old friend sent us a present of love apples. It was so refreshing to see the red, luscious fruit in the basket; but more than that, the renewal of faith in human goodness was a tonic. This man can not ever lose the precious things of life, because he gives them. Those who receive without giving even a kind word remain poor forever. More white hyacinths are needed; and more people, human and frail but kind and thoughtful, will help us to get through life pleasantly.</p>

        <p>During my second year of nursing school our professor gave us a quiz. I breezed through the questions until I read the last one: What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school? Surely this was a joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times, but how would I know her name? I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Before the class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our grade. Absolutely, the professor said. In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say hello. I’ve never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.</p>
